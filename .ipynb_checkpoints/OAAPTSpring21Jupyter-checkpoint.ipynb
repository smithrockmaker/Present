    "**Abstract:** I have been integrating python notebooks into my calc physics sequence over the last 2 years. They offer a range of curricular opportunities with relatively low lift for the instructor and students. In this presentation I will share some representative experiences as well as access to my public github where you can access everything I have done."

My focus here is a quick intro to value I have found using python notebooks in my physics and engineering courses. If I express something in a way which conflicts with your understanding of a python tool please ask and we'll all learn something."
